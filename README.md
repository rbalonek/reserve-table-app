Reserve a Table app was made to prototype a section of a freelance job I was given.

The client wanted a birthday website where his guests could register at a table. He wasn't interested in guests having to log in or put in too much sensitive info, so I made a login for him to view the guest list with all info. On this site, I've just made that a button to avoid confusion.

I plan on making another similar project with an actual login to register, and email confirmation / updates for each guest.
